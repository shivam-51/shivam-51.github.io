                    A new feature named "<a

                        >Styles Inspector</a
                    >" was requested by the design team at LibreOffice on Fall
                    of 2019. This project caught my attention as I felt out of
                    all the other projects this needs immediate attention. In
                    particular when you receive documents from other people, it
                    can be quite difficult to understand the applied formatting
                    and to fix issues around. <br /><br />
                    I write this blog with the purpose of my final report with a
                    slight glimpse of my journey during this summer. Itâ€™s been
                    quite a challenging experience, certainly more challenging
                    than I thought it would be when writing the proposal.
                    Regardless, this experience has taught me a lot and I hope
                    to continue learning and contributing to LibreOffice/open
                    source going into the future.

                <br />
                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    I had wanted to contibute in Open Source through GSoC since
                    long, this year i gave a very serious try. I chose
                    LibreOffice because the codebase was mostly in C++: the
                    language I am most familiar in. Most importantly GSoC is not
                    just about writing code, its about doing some significant
                    contribution in the organisation which in turns is
                    contributing to the world. What could have been better than
                    LO for that? the best alternative to MS Office which
                    provides its awesome tools completely for free!!<br />
                    I started getting involved with the organisation in around
                    Feb 2020. Downloaded the code base in my local machine.. set
                    up logerrit..find up a bug to solve from Bugzilla.. and you
                    are good to go. With the help of Regina I was able solve my
                    first bug and LO greets me with this beautiful mail which
                    shows they take their contributors very seriously.<br /><br />

                <br />
                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    Gradually with every new bug fix, my confidence about the
                    codebase increased and as the time
                </p>

                    At last, I want to thank my mentors Tomaz, Mike and Heiko
                    for their continued support. It was fun working with you
                    together on this project and I am very excited to present my
                    talk on the Styles Inspector at LiboCon 2020. <br />
