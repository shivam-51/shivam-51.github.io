                        >Styles Inspector</a
                    >" was requested by the design team at LibreOffice on Fall
                    of 2019. This project caught my attention as I felt out of
                    all the other projects this needs immediate attention. In
                    particular when you receive documents from other people, it
                    can be quite difficult to understand the applied formatting
                    and to fix issues around. <br /><br />
                    I write this blog with the purpose of my final report with a
                    slight glimpse of my journey during this summer. Itâ€™s been
                    quite a challenging experience, certainly more challenging
                    than I thought it would be when writing the proposal.
                    Regardless, this experience has taught me a lot and I hope
                    to continue learning and contributing to LibreOffice/open
                    source going into the future.

                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    I had wanted to contibute in Open Source through GSoC since
                    long, this year i gave a very serious try. I chose
                    LibreOffice because the codebase was mostly in C++: the
                    language I am most familiar in. Most importantly GSoC is not
                    just about writing code, its about doing some significant
                    contribution in the organisation which in turns is
                    contributing to the world. What could have been better than
                    LO for that? the best alternative to MS Office which
                    provides its awesome tools completely for free!!<br />
                    I started getting involved with the organisation in around
                    Feb 2020. Downloaded the code base in my local machine.. set
                    up logerrit..find up a bug to solve from Bugzilla.. and you
                    are good to go. With the help of Regina I was able solve my
                    first bug and LO greets me with this beautiful mail which
                    shows they take their contributors very seriously.<br /><br />

                    Gradually with every new bug fix, my confidence about the
                    codebase increased and making propsal now seemed less
                    difficult. I started discussing with my mentors how exactly
                    would the Style Inspector function and according to that
                    started looking into the codebase for similar functionality.
                    You can check my propsal

                    Working on the project was more challenging than i had
                    thought. The UI design of the the panel was completed soon
                    using Glade. My next patch was to make a property dump of
                    all the attributes for the text at the cursor. I had
                    presumed it to be completed in not more than 7 days, but
                    during this time, a major cyclone Amphan hit most eastern
                    part of India including my region which led to electricity
                    and data blackout for about a week and i was totally cut off
                    from my project. Around three weeks had passed since the
                    community bonding period had started and i was stuck with
                    nothing more than this empty panel.<br /><br />
                    <img
                        style="width: 500;"
                        height="400"
                        class="center"
                        src="img/empty.png"
                    />
                    I started losing confidence and a point came where it seemed
                    I would fail. Fortunately my mentor Mike knew about this
                    issue and helped me with a lot of code pointers. Life came
                    back to the project and the property dump was finally
                    completed. Yes, you could now see a beautiful list of more
                    than 170 properties about the text at the cursor in the
                    Styles Inspector!<br />
                    With time I understood more about the UNO API that
                    LibreOffice uses and taking referance from MRI was able to
                    divide the properties into "Paragraph Styles" and "Character
                    Styles". The Inspector is currently used just for the LO
                    Writer but later can be used for other modules too. To
                    facilitiate this the codebase for SI instead of having one
                    file which handles both UI and contents was divided such
                    that the UI will be in the svx module(so that it can be
                    easily inherited by any other class in any other module) and
                    the present implementation will be in the sw module(for
                    Writer). Inspector.

                    At last, I want to thank my mentors Tomaz, Mike and Heiko
                    for their continued support. It was fun working with you
                    together on this project and I am very excited to present my
                    talk on the Styles Inspector at LiboCon 2020. <br />
