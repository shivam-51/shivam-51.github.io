                    of 2019. This project caught my attention as I felt out of
                    all the other projects this needs immediate attention. In
                    particular when you receive documents from other people, it
                    can be quite difficult to understand the applied formatting
                    and to fix issues around. <br /><br />
                    I write this blog with the purpose of my final report with a
                    slight glimpse of my journey during this summer. Itâ€™s been
                    quite a challenging experience, certainly more challenging
                    than I thought it would be when writing the proposal.
                    Regardless, this experience has taught me a lot and I hope
                    to continue learning and contributing to LibreOffice/open
                    source going into the future.

                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    I had wanted to contibute in Open Source through GSoC since
                    long, this year i gave a very serious try. I chose
                    LibreOffice because the codebase was mostly in C++: the
                    language I am most familiar in. Most importantly GSoC is not
                    just about writing code, its about doing some significant
                    contribution in the organisation which in turns is
                    contributing to the world. What could have been better than
                    LO for that? the best alternative to MS Office which
                    provides its awesome tools completely for free!!<br />
                    I started getting involved with the organisation in around
                    Feb 2020. Downloaded the code base in my local machine.. set
                    up logerrit..find up a bug to solve from Bugzilla.. and you
                    are good to go. With the help of Regina I was able solve my
                    first bug and LO greets me with this beautiful mail which
                    shows they take their contributors very seriously.<br /><br />

                    Gradually with every new bug fix, my confidence about the
                    codebase increased and making propsal now seemed less
                    difficult. I started discussing with my mentors how exactly
                    would the Style Inspector function and according to that
                    started looking into the codebase for similar functionality.

                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    Working on the project was more challenging than i had
                    thought. The UI design of the the panel was completed soon
                    using Glade. My next patch was to make a property dump of
                    all the attributes for the text at the cursor. I had
                    presumed it to be completed in not more than 7 days, but
                    during this time, a major cyclone Amphan hit most eastern
                    part of India including my region which led to electricity
                    and data blackout for about a week and i was totally cut off
                    from my project. Around three weeks had passed since the
                    community bonding period had started and i was stuck with
                    nothing more than this empty panel.<br /><br />
                    <img

                    />
                    I started losing confidence and a point came where it seemed
                    I would fail. Fortunately my mentor Mike knew about this
                    issue and helped me with a lot of code pointers. Life came
                    back to the project and the property dump was finally
                    completed. Yes, you could now see a beautiful list of more
                    than 170 properties about the text at the cursor in the
                    Styles Inspector!<br />
                    The Inspector extensively uses the UNO API to detect the
                    style attributes. Whenever we click on any text first for
                    all the attributes it is checked if it was directly
                    formatted or is a result of any applied Paragraph Style or
                    Character Style. The hierarchy followed in terms of style
                    attributes by UNO API is :- <br />
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/shivam-51/f84405c666ec82abfb5af548785a2d7d.js"></script>
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    Accordingly for each style at each level it was checked if
                    its property state was beans::PropertyState_DIRECT_VALUE or
                    beans::PropertyState_DEFAULT_VALUE, a property will be
                    displayed in each category(DF, CS, PS) only if it is a
                    DIRECT value and all the styles with DEFAULT state will be
                    included in Default Paragraph Style as that is the "mother"
                    of all styles. The Inspector would now look like this<br /><br />
                    <img width="100%" src="img/prework.png" />
                </p>
                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    The nodes are divided into three types: Category, Simple and
                    Complex. Category type nodes are basically the main
                    categories (PS, CS and DF). Complex properties are those
                    which are styles and have properties defined for them.
                    Simple nodes are the properties having some value stored in
                    them. Currently only PS, CS and DF categories are present in
                    the Inspector but one can add say "Table Styles", "Frame
                    Styles" or any other style according to will following the
                    struct. <br />

                <p class="text" style="text-align: left;">
                    The next milestone was to grey out the properties which are
                    directly modified at a category but are overriden by any
                    different value defined at some higher level.<br />

                        A couple of bug fixes remain to be solved. When opening
                        the SI for the first time the panel shows empty, because
                        the cursor is not really on any text. At such situations
                        the panel should instead show the default state(Default
                        Paragraph Style in PS, empty CS and and empty DF). Also
                        I have added a patch for adding shortcut command to
                        launch the SI which is currently under Review and should
                        be merged soon, following which the proper icon for SI
                        should be merged. The whole list of bugs that should/may

                        At last, I want to thank my mentors Tomaz, Mike and
                        Heiko for their continued support, without which it
                        would have been impossible to make any progress. I also
                        extend my gratitude to Caolan for always replying back
                        to my UI related mails :-). <br />
                        It was fun working with you awesome people together on
                        this project.

                    <!-- With time I understood more about the UNO API that
                    LibreOffice uses and taking referance from MRI was able to
                    divide the properties into "Paragraph Styles" and "Character
                    Styles". The Inspector is currently used just for the LO
                    Writer but later can be used for other modules too. To
                    facilitiate this the codebase for SI instead of having one
                    file which handles both UI and contents was divided such
                    that the UI will be in the svx module(so that it can be
                    easily inherited by any other class in any other module) and
                    the present implementation will be in the sw module(for
                    Writer). Much Thanks to Tomaz for guiding me with this. -->
